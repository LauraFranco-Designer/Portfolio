					<h2 class="title">Redesign Philips Avent Baby Monitor</h2>
					<h1 class="subtitle">An intergation of medical features for baby care</h1>
					<p class="concept">
					This project aimed to redesign the Philips Avent Baby Monitor to enhance usability and improve the overall user experience for parents. Through in-depth user research, usability testing, and iterative prototyping, the design process focused on simplifying interactions and addressing user pain points. In addition to improving core functionality, the redesign also explored the integration of new health-related features not present in the original device. These insights were translated into practical design recommendations to create a more inclusive and intuitive product, including updates to the companion app and packaging.

					<p class="brief"> 
						As part of <a href="https://www.philips.com/global" target="_blank">Philips'</a> broader product portfolio, the <a href="https://www.philips.it/c-m-mo/baby-monitor" target="_blank">Avent Baby Monitor</a> was selected for a usability-driven redesign. The client tasked the project team with evaluating the current experience and identifying opportunities to enhance both product and app interactions. The core question was: How can we improve the usability and perceived value of the Philips Avent Baby Monitor for modern parents while integrating meaningful medical functionalities that go beyond the original offering? The challenge involved not only improving the monitor’s interaction design but also rethinking its role in supporting health awareness in everyday caregiving routines.

			<h2 class="section-title">Research Process</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<p class="text"> The research made the design team confront several important issues around privacy, ethics, data use, and safety for babies. One major concern was the impact of having a camera constantly recording a human being throughout the day. It also raised the risk of misuse, for example, parents using the monitor to watch over caregivers at all times, even when not at home, which can create trust issues.

Another key topic was how the product might lead to dependency. While it offers real benefits, like giving parents peace of mind and the freedom to go about their day without always having their baby in sight—it could also make them feel the need to stay constantly connected, which may lead to stress or anxiety.

The team also had to think carefully about how to share medical data. The goal was to give parents helpful information without overwhelming them or causing unnecessary worry. It was important to find a balance between awareness and overthinking.

Finally, there’s a risk in using the device as a replacement for a real caregiver. While the monitor can support parenting, it should never take the place of human attention, especially when a child’s safety is involved.

					<ul class="tasks-list">				
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">First-hand experience</h3>
							<p class="description">The first observation was done by one of the team members who hadn’t used the 
								product before and observed by the others. The observation started by opening the box 
								and then some scenarios which were organized in a way to cover the entire flow of the 
								interaction with the system, from the unboxing to the connection and the setup of the 
								different devices</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">Analysis of the reviews</h3>
							<p class="description">Current users speak up about their opinion of the product in online forums and product 
								review sections. They mostly describe their views and the impact of the product on their 
								life. The team summarizes the main takeaways from reviews from Amazon and Philip’s 
								online shop by taking into consideration the limitation in terms of objectivity of this step.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">Compact Field Study</h3>
							<p class="description">The research method used was a survey. The participants were parents (n=7) who already 
								used some sort of baby monitor. We targeted users who had a baby at the moment of 
								filling it in or had babies 3-4 years old. This way all the participants had fresh experiences 
								with the baby monitors. These parents all fit the targeted age group. The participants 
								were gathered through personal connections. The aim was to gather data about various 
								baby monitors’ positive and negative sides and have a better overview of the context and 
								the users.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">Usability Inspection</h3>
							<p class="description">Both cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation are conducted in order to gain the 
								last bit of understanding of the product and to start testing afterward. The cognitive 
								walkthrough, which was conducted with one team member (n=1), acted as a good 
								starting point to freely identify elements to analyze before testing them out with real 
								users. It helped the team understand how the actual user tests need to be set up.
								For the heuristic evaluation, the team selected 6 of the 10 Jakob Nielsen’s Heuristic 
								Evaluations. These turned out to be most relevant for the evaluation because they focus 
								on product feedback and control.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">User Tests</h3>
							<p class="description">Based on the insights gathered from the previous activities, a user test is conducted 
								with five mothers to analyze the monitor in the real context and understand the current 
								problems the intended user has. Besides that, the team set scenarios for the user to 
								observe how they behave with the product and what their experiences are while using 
								the product. With these findings, the team could compare the evaluation and frame the 
								problem for this project</p>

				<div class="designgoal-details1">
					<p class="text">The redesign aim to optimize and simplifie the light indicator on both the parent and camera units through the use of light strips placed on top of the devices. Animations and color variations enable users to understand the status of the devices from a distance and from all angles. Illuminated buttons provide clear feedback on user inputs, while an onboarding screen with a pre-setup feature streamlines button interactions for operating the main functions. The unboxing experience has also been improved by redesigning the packaging to facilitate a smooth and intuitive setup process.</p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Medical features integration</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="prototype-details1">
					<p class="text">Interviews with parents and literature reviews revealed that while health tracking is valued, too much data can lead to unnecessary stress. To avoid this, we focused on adding simple, non-intrusive features. Research also showed that parents prefer devices that don’t require attaching anything to the baby, so we chose to keep the existing camera and parent unit, and simply enhance their functions. The goal is not to turn Philips into a medical solution, but to offer helpful insights that support—rather than replace—parental care.</p>	
					<img src="risorse/baby_medical1.png" class="prototype-image1">				
					<p class="text">Unlike the monitor, the app includes a dedicated section called “Analytics,” focused on the baby’s health. This area doesn’t allow control of features like talk-back or night light, as the focus is on monitoring rather than interaction. The camera view remains visible but is minimized to highlight key health data such as live breathing, sleep tracking, temperature, and motion. Parents can view real-time data, daily overviews, and history from previous days, helping them stay informed without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="exhibition-details1">
					<p class="text">To improve ease of use, the team focused on helping parents quickly check the baby’s status, even from across the room. In the original design, the screen on the parent unit was hard to read from a distance. In the redesign, we introduced a light strip on the parent unit, making status updates visible from any angle. A similar light strip was added to the top of the camera unit. We also simplified multiple indicators into a single, intuitive system using color and animation to communicate the device’s status clearly. The strip on the camera unit also performs as the night light, and the unit is made more compact by saving space for the lamp.</p>
					<img src="risorse/Light feedback system.png" alt="exhibition section" class="exhibition-image">

					<p class="text">Three buttons are located on the top-right corner of the parent unit to be easily approachable. 
						They are used as ‘Hot keys’ to operate functions within one click. With the half-transparent material, 
						they are lightened up to give suggestions or indicate the active status. 
						This gives the user more confidence while using the monitor and feeling in control.</p>
					<img src="risorse/buttons system.png" alt="exhibition section" class="exhibition-image">

					<p class="text">The clip-on on the back of the monitor gives the user the possibility to wear the monitor on their 
						clothes. The clip-on will make the monitor more reliable because the user can keep it close at all 
						times while still being ergonomic.</p>

				<div class="packaging-details1">
					<p class="text">The redesigned packaging uses arrows to clearly indicate the sliding directions of the two compartments, making it easier for users to understand how to open the box and recognize that it contains two separate components. This helps users quickly identify which adapter belongs to which unit. An NFC logo on the packaging guides users to place their phone on a specific spot. As the compartments are removed, a phone-sized slot is revealed, naturally inviting the user to place their phone there. This triggers the NFC reader, directing them to the app download page—ensuring that users become aware of the app immediately upon unboxing.</p>

<div class="evaluation-details1">
<p class="text"> While keeping in mind the limitations and areas for future improvement, we can confidently say that the redesign of the Philips Avent Baby Monitor has achieved its design goal. Under key aspects like improved reliability, intuitive usability, and stronger support for parents, the project delivered meaningful enhancements. The addition of a LED light strip for clearer feedback, a more accessible onboarding process, and simplified user interaction all contributed to a more parent-friendly experience. Despite some elements still needing refinement, the redesigned system shows strong alignment with user needs and expectations.</p>
