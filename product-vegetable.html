					<h1 class="subtitle">A speculative approach to vegetable voice and rights</h1>
					<p class="concept"> We grow plants to make our homes more beautiful or to harvest vegetables and fruits, ultimately using them to fulfill our needs. This project takes a speculative approach, aiming to amplify the voices of vegetables and explore how they might express emotions in ways that humans can perceive. The core idea is to reverse the traditional human-plant relationship: instead of plants serving human purposes, humans take on the role of servants to the plants. This inversion challenges our assumptions and invites reflection on interspecies communication and empathy.</p>

					<p class="brief"> 
					How can we use state-of-the-art technologies to find smarter and more efficient approaches to food? <a href="https://www.braunhousehold.com/en" target="_blank">Braun</a> is interested in how kitchens and cooking habits might change by 2030 to make better use of food resources, join in circular systems and local products as well as make life easier, more convenient, 
and less wasteful for the home cook. The designs should be aimed at home kitchens and home cooks but can target any part of the food production, growing, planning, preparation, cooking, eating, and 
cleaning process.

				<div class="research-details1">
					<p class="text"> The design process for this project did not begin with a traditional research phase leading to concept development. Instead, it adopted a hands-on approach, starting directly with technology exploration to enable rapid prototyping and immediate testing. This fast-paced cycle of concept variation, prototyping, and evaluation fostered a "learning by doing" mindset, allowing for the practical exploration of different technologies.
The illustration below visualizes the iterative process employed throughout the project. Each loop represents a distinct cycle of refinement, through which both the concept and the final design were progressively shaped and developed.

				<div class="testing-details1">
					<p class="text">The team developed dozens and dozens of rapid high- and low-fidelity prototypes. The objective was to explore and evaluate various types of interactions in order to identify the most suitable one for achieving the intended experience behind the final concept.

These prototypes were built using scrap and waste materials, along with electronics, sensors, Arduino setups, and AI-based interaction flows. The process fostered the development of both coding skills and physical crafting techniques, including dummy models and Wizard of Oz experiments to simulate interaction and behavior.</p>

<!-- Design Goal -->
		<section class="designgoal-section" id="test">
			<h2 class="section-title">Design Goal</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="designgoal-details1">
					<p class="text">The design seeks to make plant emotions visible and audible through colored lights and sounds emitted from capsules. These sensory cues represent the state and mood of the vegetables, creating a new form of “vegetable language.” Humans will gradually learn to interpret these signals and use a megaphone to amplify the plant’s voice. However, not all communications will be accessible, some sounds will be exclusive to plant-to-plant, private interactions. This intentional opacity reinforces the idea that not all communication is human-centered, and not all messages are meant for us.</p>

<!-- prototype section -->
		<section class="prototype-section" id="test">
			<h2 class="section-title">Final prototype</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="prototype-details1">
					<p class="text">  The final prototype consists of two components: the pot and the megaphone.

The pot was made from plastic containers, inside which soil and a plant were placed. Optical fiber filaments were installed inside to carry light emitted by ring LEDs, which are activated via an Arduino board located at the external base of the plastic pot. Additionally, each pot contains an Arduino board and a battery that control the LED lights and sound output. All these components are concealed within a plywood structure fixed to the base of the pot.

The megaphone, also made of wood, houses a speaker and an Arduino board. This board is triggered by a magnetic sensor that activates the system when the megaphone is brought close to a magnet positioned on the pot’s structure.</p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Intended Use</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="designgoal-details1">
					<p class="text">The plants become a communicating community among themselves. This activity is expressed through intentionally indecipherable lights and sounds emitted by the designed pots. The human is required to take action: bringing a megaphone close to the pot to "amplify" and attempt to translate the message the plant is conveying. The design aims to act as a mediator between two often misunderstood and distant worlds: the human and the vegetal.</p>

				<div class="exhibition-details1">
					<p class="text">  The final exhibition provided a valuable opportunity to showcase the project to the client, Braun, while also gathering key insights for future development. The exhibition space was designed to evoke a dark, futuristic atmosphere, enhancing the presence of both the capsule and the plants. No descriptions or explanations were provided to visitors, encouraging them to immerse themselves in the environment and discover how to interact with the plants on their own. Through brief conversations, we gained insight into their experiences and emotions. This approach allowed us to assess the intuitiveness of the design while also giving visitors time to reflect on a topic that is often overlooked. </p>
